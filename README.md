# TheMeanOnesServerSideMeleePack--7D2D
A ServerSide Custom Melee weapon pack that pushes the limits of ServerSide weapon Mods on 7D2D.


Introducing TheMeanOnes ServerSide Melee Weapons, the first of its kind to creatively turn everyday items into devastating melee weapons! From mailboxes to parking meters and even a flimsy umbrella spear, this mod offers a unique spin on survival weaponry without requiring client-side downloads.

# Weapons Included:
MailBox Bat
"A Bad Ass Mailbox bat to bash zeds heads in!"
Weak Umbrella Spear
"A cheap alternative to jab zeds with - bring on the rain!"
Parking Meter of Death
"These Zeds didn’t pay to park, so let’s beat the change out of them!"

# Craftable in the Workbench:
Each weapon can be crafted in the Workbench, offering a fair yet accessible way to arm yourself with these unique tools of destruction.


# Why This Mod is Special:
Server-Side Only: No client downloads needed – players can join and immediately enjoy these new weapons.
Vanilla-Compatible: Uses existing game assets cleverly repurposed for fresh, creative content.
Craftable: All weapons are easily craftable in the Workbench, seamlessly integrating into progression.
Community-Driven Expansion: This is just the beginning! I plan to expand this mod with more weapons based on community feedback and player requests. I made this to show the capabilities of what can be done, as well as add to the evergoing selection of ServerSide Mods.
